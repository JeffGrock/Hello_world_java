 * Question 6: After compiling, i'm notified that there is a compiler error that
 *              "Package system does not exist".
 * Question 7: Breaking the line of code after "Hello" causes a whole host of
 *               syntax errors on both lines. These are pointed out to me my the compiler.
 * Question 8: The program compiles and runs without error, however, the
 *              second sentence is printed on the same line as the first.
 *
